[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" My role on the team In the beginning, three members of the team each represent three different backgrounds of business, user experience, and technology, and I am the technology person considering my computer science background. Originally, I supposed myself would be like stopping my teammates from overly relying on technologies and telling them what\u0026rsquo;s impossible for the technology during the discussion. In the end, it turns out that I am the one overly relying on technical solutions since we keep refining our solutions based on the user research we have been conducted.\nDesign question and the process Our final design question in this studio is \u0026ldquo;How can we make it more efficient for people to prepare meals for a large group of people with different dietary habits before parties in the kitchen?\u0026rdquo;. We found that the majority of people surveyed admit that preparing for dinner parties is difficult: 69% of women admit to taking a day off to prepare for their dinner party; 84% have lied to their partner about how much they spend on a dinner party(source).\nAnd we also found typical online recipes are not helpful at all: their advice is often too general and vague, not suitable for making multiple dishes simultaneously, or requiring massive efforts to study. Moreover, Half of Americans host home parties at least once a month (source) and more than half of Americans eat gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, or no-dairy meals. (source). It is quite clear that people who are going to host a party could use a solution that helps them better in preparing for food party and dealing with different dietary habits at one time. Our target users in this scope are people who are going to host a food party for a large group (5-20) of people and inexperienced at it.\nWe were mostly looking for articles from culinary magazines, searching for famous bloggers on organizing large parties, reading recommendations from nutritionists. However, the most difficult part for us is to have the quantity data. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to have market share estimation and numbers of people suffering from the problem. It is clear that the problem exists but it is hard to know how big it is at the same time. If we could the secondary research again, we should make sure that not only we have easy access to the target environment for observation but also easy access to clear and comprehensive both qualitative and quantitative data. We also survey our intended topics.\nBased on results from secondary research, and twice field studies in the public kitchen of an apartment we conducted, we came up with several design requirements from high to low priority.\nHigh Priority [User] Our solution should be easy and convenient to use in the kitchen. [Justification] Although people use smartphones in the kitchen, it is currently inconvenient becauseThey have to use their hands.\n[Technology] Our solution should utilize audio interaction. [Justification] People listen to music a lot in the kitchen, so the audio could be a convenient medium.\n[Technology] Our solution should be able to be used on smartphones/tablets/laptops. [Justification] According to our survey, most people still rely on smartphones/tablets/laptops to do their planning and cooking and not buy new devices.\nMedium Priority [User] Our solution should help users accommodate different dietary restrictions. [Justification] In our survey, 30% of people who don’t ask for guests’ dietary restrictions before the planning party claimed that it’s hard for them to accommodate different restrictions and this is in parallel with our assumption.\n[User] Our solution should be a better and more convenient way than existing solutions. [Justification] People rely on smartphones mostly even though their hands are dirty.\n[Business] The pricing of our solution should be around $20. [Justification] More than 40% of people surveyed are willing to pay more than ​$20 for our service.\n[User] Our solution should accommodate multiple users at the same time. [Justification] Half of our survey takers work with others when cooking for a food party, so we should let them use our product at the same time.\n[User] Our solution should include helping our users to plan for special occasions and events. [Justification] 60% of our survey takers claim that their top priority for planning the party is based on the occasion or reason of the party (e.g. birthday, Thanksgiving).\n[User] Our solution should reduce the effort and time it takes to prepare a meal for a large group of people. [Justification] Effort and time spent on preparing food are prioritized by most of our survey takers.\nLow Priority [User] Our solution should accommodate different cooking tools. [Justification] We observe different cooking tools (e.g. normal kitchen, grilling rack) used in our different times of field study.\n[User] Our solution should take into consideration the availability of ingredients. [Justification] Availability of material is prioritized by most of our survey takers.\n[User] Our solution should provide an estimation of the amount of food to be prepared. [Justification] We noticed the left-over problem in both our observations and people complain about the cost of our research.\n[Business] Our solution should be advertised differently from existing solutions. [Justification] Since online tutorial/recipe is our major competitor in the market, we might try to separate ourselves from them in marketing and image branding.\n[User] Our solution should create a shopping list for ingredients for the entire party planning. [Justification] In our secondary research, the cost of the party is people worrying about. Our solution should calculate accurately and output the shopping list for people to refer to.\nWe build our solution around design requirements, so we came up with four principles \u0026ldquo;convenience\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;voice assistant\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;multitask\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;planning\u0026rdquo;:\n Convenience: Easily accessed recipes, generated shopping list, instructions Voice Assistant: Hands-free experience in the kitchen. Multitask: Clear directions and multitask planning algorithm. Planning: Comprehensive organizing party  Then we came up with a low-fidelity app-like prototype that has these features. Here is the prototype link. We use online prototyping tools Balsamiq to create the prototype. The things we learned from tests show are majorly discrepancy between users\u0026rsquo; understanding and ours about our prototypes. For example, users, in the beginning, did not quite understand the workflow of our prototype, and some users even questioned the design of some buttons and functions.\nReflection for entire design thinking journey We use a lot of techniques during this process, for example, brainstorming, sketching, affinity diagram, etc. Personally, my favorite ones are sketching and creating personas for the design question. These techniques allow us to review our imagined solution more discretely and realistically. To people with an engineering background like me, the process and techniques used in design thinking are mind-blowing. Most of the time engineers spend too much time on the solution, rather than the question itself. As a result, products without guidance like user research techniques are mostly solving problems that do not exist at all. It is a valuable experience to learn and apply such skillset to focus on the question first and thoroughly.\n","date":1576023487,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576023487,"objectID":"2fe8e6b12f2b192eb77271c03ae61d88","permalink":"/project/design-thinking/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T16:18:07-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/design-thinking/","section":"project","summary":"My design thiking journey into developing assistance to hosting home parties","tags":[],"title":"Design Thinking","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hsuan-Kung Yang∗, Tsu-Jui Fu∗, Po-Han Chiang†, Kuan-Wei Ho†, Chun-Yi Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568161666,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568161666,"objectID":"d00c9535d6021003bb39a9f96ca1e92a","permalink":"/publication/iccd-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-10T17:27:46-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/iccd-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a methodology for enhancing the throughput of semantic video segmentation tasks on an embedded cluster containing multiple embedded processing elements (ePEs). The methodology embraces a scalable master-slave hierarchy and features a global and local key management scheme for allocating video frames to different ePEs. The master ePE divides each video frame into frame regions, and dynamically distributes different regions to different slave ePEs. Each slave ePE executes either a segmentation path or a flow path: the former is highly accurate but slower, while the latter is faster but less accurate. A lightweight decision network is employed to determine the execution path for each slave ePE. We propose a global and local key management scheme to facilitate the execution of the embedded cluster, such that the average processing latency of each frame is significantly reduced. We evaluate the performance of our methodology on a real embedded cluster in terms of accuracy and frame rate, and validate its effectiveness and efficiency for various ePE configurations. We further provide a detailed latency analysis for different configurations of ePEs.

Semantic modeling faces a new challenge in social media because grammatical inaccuracy is commonplace yet many previous state-of-the-art methods exploit grammatical structure. For sarcasm detection over social media content, researchers so far have counted on Bag-of-Words, N-grams and etc. In this project, we apply a neural network semantic model for sarcasm detection on Twitter sarcasm dataset.\nWe propose to combine CNN(1D) with LSTM in this project. CNN(1D) extract proper local feature extraction which resembles 1-gram. After the feature extraction, LSTM can fully learn the hidden information behind the context of sequences of higher level features provided by CNN(1D). Such design is often seen in tasks requiring comprehending sequences of images or sounds, such as activity classification or sound classification. We believe that the mixture of CNNs and RNNs can work well also in semantic analysis, as the architecture utilizes both networks’ advantages.\nIn order to demonstrate the vaildility of the sarcasm detection model, we designed a GUI interface with keywords searching on Twitter. The system can download keywords-matched tweet immediately from Twitter and detect the sarcasm. The demonstration result can be found in PDF report.\n","date":1546332886,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546332886,"objectID":"4a2de085053da6094d07b5dd6ee1edb7","permalink":"/project/twitter-sarcasm-detection/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T16:54:46+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/twitter-sarcasm-detection/","section":"project","summary":"Mixed approach of CNN and LSTM on Twitter Sarcasm Dataset","tags":[],"title":"Twitter Sarcasm Detection","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hsuan-Kung Yang","An-Chieh Cheng∗","Kuan-Wei Ho∗","Tsu-Jui Fu","Chun-Yi Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546260889,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546260889,"objectID":"9faaab3b2ff8b211ea69cfde1418d911","permalink":"/publication/pic-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-12-31T20:54:49+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pic-workshop/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we investigate the use of an unsupervised label clustering technique and demonstrate that it enables substantial improvements in visual relationship prediction accuracy on the Person in Context (PIC) dataset.

Label clustering not only mitigates both the large classification space and class imbalance issues, but also potentially increases data samples for each clustered category. We further propose to incorporate depth information as an additional feature into the instance segmentation model. The additional depth prediction path supplements the relationship prediction model in a way that bounding boxes or segmentation masks are unable to deliver.
